# HTML_Portfolio
 Portfolio created using only HTML 

This portfolio shows my recent projects during my 1st and 2nd year uni. It highlights my skills and knowledge as well as my contacts should there be any questions.

To run the portfolio in your device you need to download the following
- [Github Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/download/)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
- [Visual Studio Code (VSCode)](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

After downloading Visual Studio Code (VSCode) get the extension Live Server.

Next download as zip the repository from github.

Right after that open Github Desktop and press file and press add local repository and choose filepath for the downloaded repository and then press the button open in visual studio code and the HTML portfolio should now be visible

For any troubleshooting/questions related to this message johncordon7@gmail.com
